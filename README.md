## Designing Horiseons website to be as accessible as possible

As part of a class project, we refactored a previously existing code for Horiseon's website to follow the best of accessibility standards and be optimized for search engines while ensuring that the design looked just as beautiful as before. Here are the things we did to achieve our goal:

- Ensured that semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
- Made sure that HTML elements followed a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Image and icon elements were given accessible alt attributes 
- Removed duplicated and unecessary css stylings from the css file
- Condensed the HTML file to be more structural
- Ensured  that heading attributes fall in sequential order
- Gave the title element concise and descriptive text
